# Week 06 & 07: Java Backend - Spring Boot

Welcome to the repository for Weeks 6 and 7 of our Java learning journey. These weeks marked our transition into Java Backend Development using the Spring Framework. We started by building a Java web server using servlets and progressed to developing RESTful APIs with Spring Boot. Key concepts covered include controller-service-repo architecture, DTOs, validations, exception handling, and database connectivity.

## Overview

Weeks 6 and 7 explored backend development with Java using the Spring Framework. You started by understanding servlet-based web applications and quickly moved into building RESTful services using Spring Boot. By the end, you had a functional Employee Payroll Application with layered architecture, database integration, validations, and exception handling.
